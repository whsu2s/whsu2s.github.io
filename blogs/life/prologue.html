                    An eight-year life in Germany was like taking a long train ride through unfamiliar landscapes—at times smooth and scenic, other times delayed and uncertain, occasionally pausing in places I never expected to be.
                Those years became a kind of planting season. Some seeds took root quietly, beneath the surface—patience, faith, resilience. 
                Others blossomed more visibly.
                Leaving was like packing up a beloved room at dusk. I knew the journey was ending, but each corner still held the warmth of stories I wasn’t quite ready to let go. 
                Returning home has been unexpectedly disorienting—familiar streets now feel slightly out of focus, and the pace of life moves differently. Yet in the midst of that, I carry a deep gratitude for what those eight years gave me.

                    In this blog series, I want to share fragments from that time as glimpses into a lived experience. 
                You’ll find stories of detours and discoveries, of learning to cook for others and learning to wait in faith, of finding meaning in small routines and beauty in ordinary days.
